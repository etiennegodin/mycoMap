The interaction between precipitation and temperature modulated mushroom production.
•
Mushroom production was enhanced by mushrooms species richness.
•
Ectomycorrhizal species richness was mainly affected by stand characteristics.
•
Species richness of saprotrophic mushrooms was affected by pH of the soil.

Ambient temperature, soil humidity, and especially precipitation in the summer and autumn seem to be the most important factors explaining differences in mushroom production

Among other environmental characteristics, nitrogen concentration, pH, type of soil, slope, and elevation are listed as main predictors of mushroom production

The type of soil also matters, as fewer mushrooms are observed in soils with decreasing proportion of sand

Among basic tree stand characteristics, stand age, stand basal area, and canopy cover are most commonly reported to have the greatest impact on mushroom production. Mushroom yield is higher in younger stands, due to the faster growth rate of young trees


Tree identity and tree species richness influence the fungal biomass and species composition of fungi.


They also revealed that tree composition can explain a large proportion of variation in the species composition of fungal communities, even greater than soil properties
