### The macrofungal flora of the deciduous forest was composed mainly of many infrequent species, whereas coniferous forests had few, but very frequent, macrofungi. 
### Species richness decreased gradually (from 125 to 34 species) towards the north and with increasing altitude. Both the Simpson and the Shannon- Wiener diversity indices were significantly lower in the coniferous forest when compared with the deciduous forest. This decrease in diversity was due to the scarcity of saprophytic fungi in mor humus, whereas the number of ectornycorrhizal species remained constant.

### The diversity of saprophytic fungi was related significantly to that of vascular plants, whereas the diversity of ectomycorrhizal macrofungi was related mainly to the percent cover of ectornycorrhizal hosts. 


### Species composition of the coniferous forest differed from the former in
the clear dominance of ectornycorrhizal macrofungi from the Cortinariaceae, Russulaceae, and the Boletaceae. In the black
spruce - cladina association, saprophytic fungi were scarce and ectomycorrhizal species were also relatively infrequent. In
all the sites, the equitability of macrofungal frequency was high, as seen by the high proportion of rare species. The decline
in species richness observed in this study, when moving from deciduous to coniferous forests, corresponds well with the
increase in environmental rigor and instability, as well as the decrease in the diversity of organic substrate and species of
vascular plants.

The primary abiotic variables that impact mushroom production are temperature, humidity, light,

The interaction between precipitation and temperature modulated mushroom production.
•
Mushroom production was enhanced by mushrooms species richness.
•
Ectomycorrhizal species richness was mainly affected by stand characteristics.
•
Species richness of saprotrophic mushrooms was affected by pH of the soil.

Ambient temperature, soil humidity, and especially precipitation in the summer and autumn seem to be the most important factors explaining differences in mushroom production

Among other environmental characteristics, nitrogen concentration, pH, type of soil, slope, and elevation are listed as main predictors of mushroom production

The type of soil also matters, as fewer mushrooms are observed in soils with decreasing proportion of sand

Among basic tree stand characteristics, stand age, stand basal area, and canopy cover are most commonly reported to have the greatest impact on mushroom production. Mushroom yield is higher in younger stands, due to the faster growth rate of young trees


Tree identity and tree species richness influence the fungal biomass and species composition of fungi.


They also revealed that tree composition can explain a large proportion of variation in the species composition of fungal communities, even greater than soil properties
