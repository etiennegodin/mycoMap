Negative Binomial Regression: More flexible, allows variance > mean (overdispersion), common in ecology.
Zero-Inflated Models (ZIP/ZINB): Useful if you have far more zero-richness cells than expected. They model the zero-generating process separately from the count-generating process.

Robustness of Tree Models: Often, tree-based ensemble models like Random Forest handle count-like data quite well without explicitly assuming a distribution, making them a good default choice.
