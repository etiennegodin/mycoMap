## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

1. **Inspect distributions**
    
    - Plot histograms for numerical features (e.g. temperature, precipitation, population density, distance to road).
        
    - Check for skewness or heavy tails; consider log‐transforming highly skewed variables (e.g. distance to road).
        
2. **Handle missing data**
    
    - If only a few missing values → impute (mean/median for numeric; most‐frequent for categorical).
        
    - If entire features are sparsely sampled → consider dropping them.
        
3. **Encode categorical & ordered features**
    
    - **Ordered categories** (e.g. soil quality classes): use `OrdinalEncoder` with an explicit ordering list.
        
    - **Nominal categories** (e.g. land‐cover type): use `OneHotEncoder` (for low‐cardinality) or a target/mean‐encoder (for high‐cardinality).
        
4. **Feature scaling**
    
    - Tree‐based models don’t require scaling.
        
    - If you experiment with distance‐ or kernel‐based methods (e.g. KNN, SVR), wrap numeric features in a `StandardScaler` or `RobustScaler`
## 2. Dealing with Spatial & Sampling Bias

- **Include your bias covariates** (population density, distance to road, sampling effort proxies) directly as predictors.
    
- **Spatial cross‐validation**: don’t randomly split grid cells, but group them by spatial clusters (e.g. use `sklearn`’s `GroupKFold` with a spatial clustering index) to test performance in novel areas.
## 3. Model Selection & Evaluation

- **Baseline**: start with a simple `RandomForestRegressor` or `GradientBoostingRegressor` (`xgboost` or `lightgbm`).
    
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: use `RandomizedSearchCV` or `BayesianOptimization` over number of trees, max depth, learning rate, etc.
    
- **Metrics**:
    
    - **Regression**: RMSE, MAE, R².
        
    - **Residual analysis**: plot residuals vs. bias covariates to see if biases remain.
