# Steps
- [ ] Aggregate Raw Data over Quebec
- [ ] Research ecological factors influencing fungi presence 
- [ ] Categorise species by type
	- [ ] Sapotrophic, mychorizal, parasitic
- [ ] Create predictor variables from raw data
	- [ ] [[Carbon  Nitrogen ratio]]
	- [ ] [[soil Ph]]
	- [ ] [[Soil Moisture]]
	- [ ] [[Wood decay]]

- [ ] Use predictor variables in rule based model to infer species richness
	- [ ] maybe cross check against real observed
