# Examples of Hypotheses to Test
Fungi species richness increases with tree stand diversity index.
Fungi species X is more likely to occur on soils of type A than type B.
Higher tree height classes are associated with lower fungi diversity.
Slope class has a significant impact on fungi community composition.
Tree density class predicts the presence of specific fungi species.


## Ecological Niche

Identify the niche preferences of fungi species by studying the abiotic conditions associated with their occurrences.
Species Distribution Models (SDMs)

Use statistical models (e.g., logistic regression, MaxEnt, or random forests) to predict species distributions based on abiotic factors.
## Biodiversity Indices

Assess diversity (species richness, evenness) and how it relates to environmental variables like Shannon index or tree density.
## Community Assembly Rules

Examine whether species assembly is influenced more by abiotic filtering (environmental constraints) or biotic interactions (e.g., competition).
Gradient Analysis

Study how species composition changes across gradients such as slope or tree density (beta diversity).

## Species-Habitat Associations

Which abiotic factors are most strongly associated with the presence of specific fungi species?
Are certain fungi species more common in specific soil types, slope classes, or areas with particular tree stand diversity?
Biodiversity Patterns

How does fungi species richness (number of species) vary with tree stand diversity or Shannon index?
Is there a correlation between fungi diversity and tree stand diversity?
## Environmental Gradients

How do environmental gradients (e.g., slope, tree height, soil type) influence fungi distribution and abundance?
Are there threshold effects where certain conditions favor or inhibit fungi occurrences?
Co-occurrence Patterns

Do certain fungi species co-occur in the same areas, and what abiotic conditions favor these co-occurrences?
Are there signs of niche partitioning among species?
Predictive Modeling

Can you predict the occurrence of specific fungi species based on abiotic variables?
